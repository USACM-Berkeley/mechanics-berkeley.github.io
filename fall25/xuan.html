            <p><b>Abstract:</b> 
				        Conventional phase field modeling of fracture uses the degraded strain energy density (SED) as a material 
                damage index to drive crack growth. To avoid non-physical evolution in the crack phase-field, various SED 
                splitting schemes have been adopted, resulting in the development of ‘‘anisotropic’’-SED-based formulations. 
                In this work, we propose a stress-intensity-factor-driven (SIF-driven) phase field method as an alternative 
                to better capture the realistic crack nucleation and propagation under mixed-mode loading. The key 
                contributions of this work include: (1) accurate representation of crack tip stress asymptotic field, (2) 
                precise prediction of crack growth and material failure without the need for additional splitting techniques, 
                (3) bridging the gap between phase-field formulation for fracture and well-established LEFM theories, and (4) 
                providing a numerically efficient and straightforward implementation that closely resembles that of 
                conventional phase field methods.</p>

				        Xuan Hu is a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of 
                California, Berkeley, working with Professor Shaofan Li. He earned his master’s degree from UC Berkeley in 
                2021 and his bachelor’s from Wuhan University in 2017. His research focuses on computational mechanics, 
                material and structural failure, with expertise in advanced numerical methods such as the phase-field method 
                and bond-associated peridynamics.</p>
